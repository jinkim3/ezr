Description: Runs a Shiny App in the local machine for basic
    statistical and graphical analyses. The Shiny App's point-and-click
    interface enables obtaining the same analysis outputs (e.g., plots and
    tables) more quickly, as compared with typing the required code in R,
    especially for users without much experience or expertise with coding.
    Examples of possible analyses include tabulating descriptive
    statistics for a variable, creating histograms by experimental groups,
    and creating a scatter plot and calculating the correlation between
    two variables.
